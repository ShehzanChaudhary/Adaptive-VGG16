CIFAR-10 Image Classification with VGG16 Optimization
Project Description
This project aims to optimize the VGG16 deep learning model for accurately classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, making it an excellent benchmark for evaluating image classification algorithms. The optimization focuses on reducing model size, improving time complexity, and enhancing overall performance.

Problem Statement
Our primary objective is to create a robust image classification system that can generalize well to unseen data and perform effectively across various classes within the CIFAR-10 dataset. To achieve this, we:

Analyze the CIFAR-10 dataset to understand its structure, class distribution, and image characteristics.
Customize and optimize the VGG16 convolutional neural network architecture.
Optimize hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and regularization strength to maximize performance while preventing overfitting.
Employ training and validation techniques to ensure the model generalizes well to new data.
Iterate on the model design and conduct error analysis to continuously improve the system.
